# HTTP Toolkit WebExtension [![Build Status](https://github.com/httptoolkit/webextension/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/httptoolkit/webextension/actions)

> _Part of [HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.tech): powerful tools for building, testing & debugging HTTP(S)_

A browser extension used in HTTP Toolkit to intercept non-HTTP browser requests (specifically: hooking WebRTC to mock it automatically with [MockRTC](https://github.com/httptoolkit/mockrtc)).

Right now this is not useful standalone - only when combined with HTTP Toolkit for setup. In future it may be usable for automtaed RTC testing (but not today).
